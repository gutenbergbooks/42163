the limbs is full of skill, and the background adds considerably to the

employed the same model for most of his studies of the Madonna.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h3>A RETROSPECT</h3>


<p>In the beginning of the long and fascinating
history of Italian Art we see that
the spirit of the Renaissance first fluttered
over the minds of men much as the spirit
of life is said have moved over the face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the waters before the first chapter of
creation&rsquo;s marvellous story was written.
Beginnings were small, progress was slow,
and the lives of the great artists moved
very unevenly to their appointed end.</p>

<p>There were some who rose to fame and
fortune during their life, and then died so
completely that no biography can hope to
rouse any interest in their work among
succeeding generations.</p>

<p>There were others who worked in silence
and without <i>r&eacute;clame</i> of any sort, content
with the respect and esteem of those with
whom they came into immediate contact,
indifferent to the plaudits of the crowd or
the noisy praises of those who are not
qualified to judge. True servants of the
western world&rsquo;s religion, they translated
work into terms of moral life, and moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
life into terms of work. Merit like truth
will out, and when time has sifted good
work from bad and spurious reputations
from genuine ones, many men who fluttered
the dovecotes of their own generation disappear
from sight altogether; some others
who wrought unseen, never striving to gain
the popular ear or eye, rise on a sudden to
heights that might have made them giddy
had they lived to be conscious of their own
elevation. They were lowly, but their fame
inherits the earth.</p>

<p>Bernardino Luini, the subject of this
little study, calls us away from the great
art centres&mdash;from Venice and Florence and
Rome; his record was made and is to be
found to-day amid the plains of Lombardy.
Milan is not always regarded as one of the
great art centres of Italy in spite of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Brera, the Ambrosiana, and the Poldi Pezzoli
Palace collections, but no lover of pictures
ever went for the first time to the galleries
of Milan in a reverent spirit and with a
patient eye without feeling that he had
discovered a painter of genius. He may
not even have heard his name before, but
he will come away quite determined to learn
all he may about the man who painted the
wonderful frescoes that seem destined to
retain their spiritual beauty till the last faint
trace of the design passes beyond the reach
of the eye, the man who painted the panel
picture of the &ldquo;Virgin of the Rose Trees,&rdquo;
reproduced with other of his master-works
in these pages.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%;">
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE II.&mdash;IL SALVATORE</span>
<p class="center"><b>(In the Ambrosiana, Milan)</b></p>

<p>This picture, one of the treasures of the beautiful collection in the
Pinacoteca of Ambrosiana in the Piazza della Rosa, hangs by the
same artist&rsquo;s picture of &ldquo;John the Baptist as a Child.&rdquo; The right hand
of Christ is raised in the attitude of benediction, and the head has
a curiously genuine beauty. The preservation of this picture is
wonderful, the colouring retains much of its early glow. The head
is almost feminine in its tenderness and bears a likeness to Luini&rsquo;s
favourite model.</p>
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE II.&mdash;IL SALVATORE" title="" />
</div>


<p>To go to the Brera is to feel something
akin to hunger for the history of Bernardino
Luini or Luino or Luvino as he is called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
by the few who have found occasion to
mention him, although perhaps Luini is the
generally accepted and best known spelling
of the name. Unfortunately the hungry
feeling cannot be fully satisfied. Catalogues
or guide books date the year of Luini&rsquo;s
birth at or about 1470, and tell us that he
died in 1533, and as this is a period that
Giorgio Vasari covers, we turn eagerly to
the well-remembered volumes of the old
gossip hoping to find some stories of the
Lombard painter&rsquo;s life and work. We are
eager to know what manner of man Luini
was, what forces influenced him, how he
appeared to his contemporaries, whether
he had a fair measure of the large success
that attended the leading artists of his day.
Were his patrons great men who rewarded
him as he deserved&mdash;how did he fare when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the evening came wherein no man may
work? Surely there is ample scope for the
score of quaint comments and amusing if
unreliable anecdotes with which Vasari
livens his pages. We are confident that
there will be much to reward the search, because
Bernardino Luini and Giorgio Vasari
were contemporaries after a fashion. Vasari
would have been twenty-one years old
when Luini died, the writer of the &ldquo;Lives&rdquo;
would have seen frescoes and panel pictures
in all the glory of their first creation. He
could not have failed to be impressed by
the extraordinary beauty of the artist&rsquo;s conceptions,
the skill of his treatment of single
figures, the wealth of the curious and elusive
charm that we call atmosphere&mdash;a charm to
which all the world&rsquo;s masterpieces are indebted
in varying degrees&mdash;the all-pervading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
sense of a delightful and refined personality,
leaves us eager for the facts that must have
been well within the grasp of the painter&rsquo;s
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Alas for these expectations! Vasari
dismisses Bernardino del Lupino, as he
calls him, in six or eight sentences, and
what he says has no biographical value at
all. The reference reads suspiciously like
what is known in the world of journalism
as padding. Indeed, as Vasari was a fair
judge, and Bernardino Luini was not one
of those Venetians whom Vasari held more
or less in contempt, there seems to be
some reason for the silence. Perhaps it
was an intimate and personal one, some
unrecorded bitterness between the painter
and one of Vasari&rsquo;s friends, or between
Vasari himself and Luini or one of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
brothers or children. Whatever the cause
there is no mistake about the result. We
grumble at Vasari, we ridicule his inaccuracies,
we regret his limitations, we scoff
at his prejudices, but when he withholds
the light of his investigation from contemporary
painters who did not enjoy the
favour of popes and emperors, we wander
in a desert land without a guide, and search
with little or no success for the details that
would serve to set the painter before us.</p>

<p>Many men have taken up the work of investigation,
for Luini grows steadily in favour
and esteem, but what Vasari might have done
in a week nobody has achieved in a decade.</p>

<p>A few unimportant church documents
relating to commissions given to the painter
are still extant. He wrote a few words
on his frescoes; here and there a stray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
reference appears in the works of Italian
writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, but our knowledge when it has
been sifted and arranged is remarkably
small and deplorably incomplete. Dr. J. C.
Williamson, a painstaking critic and a competent
scholar, has written an interesting
volume dealing with the painter, and in the
making of it he has consulted nearly fifty
authorities&mdash;Italian, French, English, and
German&mdash;only to find it is impossible to
gather a short chapter of reliable and consecutive
biography from them all. Our
only hope lies in the discovery of some
rich store of information in the public or
private libraries of Milan among the manuscripts
that are the delight of the scholars.
Countless documents lie unread, many
famous libraries are uncatalogued, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
archives of several noble Italian houses
that played an important part in fifteenth
and sixteenth century Italy have still to
be given to the world. It is not unreasonable
to suppose that records of Luini&rsquo;s life
exist, and in these days when scholarship
is ever extending its boundaries there is
hope that some scholar will lay the ever
growing circle of the painter&rsquo;s admirers
under lasting obligations. Until that time
comes we must be content to know the
man through the work that he has left
behind him, through the medium of fading
frescoes, stray altarpieces, and a few panel
pictures. Happily they have a definite and
pleasant story to tell.</p>

<p>We must go to Milan for Luini just as
we must go to Rome for Raphael and to
Madrid for Velazquez and Titian and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Venice for Jacopo Robusti whom men still
call the Little Dyer (Tintoretto). In London
we have one painting on wood, &ldquo;Christ and
the Pharisees,&rdquo; brought from the Borghese
Palace in Rome. The head of Christ is
strangely feminine, the four Pharisees round
him are finely painted, and the picture has
probably been attributed to Leonardo da
Vinci at some period of its career. There
are three frescoes in South Kensington and
a few panel pictures in private collections.
The Louvre is more fortunate than our
National Gallery, it has several frescoes
and two or three panels. In Switzerland,
in the Church of St. Mary and the Angels
in Lugano, is a wonderful screen picture
of the &ldquo;Passion of Christ&rdquo; with some hundreds
of figures in it, and the rest of
Luini&rsquo;s work seems to be in Italy. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
greater part is to be found in Milan, some
important frescoes having been brought to
the Brera from the house of the Pelucca
family in Monza, while there are some important
works in Florence in the Pitti and
Uffizi Galleries. In the Church of St. Peter
at Luino on the shores of Lake Maggiore,
the little town where Benardino was born
and from which he took his name, there
are some frescoes but they are in a very
faded condition. The people of the lake
side town have much to say about the master
who has made Luino a place of pilgrimage
but their stories are quite unreliable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE III.&mdash;SALOM&Eacute; AND THE HEAD OF ST. JOHN
THE BAPTIST</span>
<p class="center"><b>(In the Uffizi Gallery, Florence)</b></p>

<p>In this striking and finely preserved picture Bernardino Luini has
contrived to avoid all sense of horror. The head of the dead John
the Baptist is full of beauty, and even Herodias is handled without
any attempt to make her repulsive. Sufficient contrast is supplied
by the executioner on the right.</p>
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE III.&mdash;SALOM&Eacute; AND THE HEAD OF ST. JOHN
THE BAPTIST" title="" />
</div>

<p>It might be held, seeing that the artist&rsquo;s
work is scanty, and often in the last stages
of decay, while his life story has faded quite
from the recovered records of his contemporaries,
that Luini is hardly fit subject for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
discussion here. In a series of little books
that seeks to introduce great artists to new
friends through the medium of reproductions
that show the work as it is, and a brief
concise description that aims at helping
those who are interested to study the
master for themselves, there is a temptation
to deal only with popular men. These
give no trouble to their biographer or his
readers, but after all it is not the number
of pictures that an artist paints or the
wealth of detail that his admirers have
collected that establishes his claim to be
placed among the immortals. His claim
rests upon the quality of the work done,
its relation to the times in which it was
painted, the mood or spirit it reveals, the
light it throws upon the mind that conceived
and the hand that executed it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>We know enough and to spare of the
more flamboyant personalities of the
Venetian and Florentine schools. Long
periods of study will not exhaust all there
is to learn about men like Titian, Michelangelo,
Raphael of Urbino, and the rest,
but Luini, though he left no written record,
will not be denied. We dare not pass him
by, seeing that we may introduce him to
some admirers who will, in days to come,
seek and find what remains beyond our
reach at present. His appeal is so irresistible,
the beauty of his work is so rare and
so enduring that we must endeavour to the
best of our ability, however small it be, to
declare his praise, to stimulate inquiry,
enlarge his circle, and give him the place
that belongs to him of right. There are
painters in plenty whose work is admired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and praised, whose claims we acknowledge
instantly while admitting to ourselves that
we should not care to live with their pictures
hanging on round us. The qualities of
cleverness and brilliance pall after a little
time, the mere conquest of technical difficulties
of the kind that have been self-inflicted
rouses admiration for a while and
then leaves us cold. But the man who is
the happy possessor of a fresco or a panel
picture by Luini is to be envied. Even he
who lives in the neighbourhood of some
gallery or church and only sees the rare
master&rsquo;s works where, &ldquo;blackening in the
daily candle smoke, they moulder on the
damp wall&rsquo;s travertine,&rdquo; will never tire of
Luini&rsquo;s company. He will always find inspiration,
encouragement, or consolation in
the reflection of the serene and beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
outlook upon life that gave the work so
much of its enduring merit. Luini, whatever
manner of man he may have been,
was so clearly enamoured of beauty, so
clearly intolerant of what is ugly and unrefined,
that he shrank from all that was
coarse and revolting either in the life around
him or in certain aspects of the Bible stories
that gave him subjects for his brush. Beauty
and simplicity were the objects of his unceasing
search, his most exquisite expression.</p>

<p>Like all other great painters he had his
marked periods of development, his best
work was done in the last years of his life,
but there is nothing mean or trivial in any
picture that he painted and this is the
more to his credit because we know from
the documents existing to-day that he lived
in the world and not in the cloister. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
admire the perennial serenity of Beato
Angelico, we rejoice with him in his exquisite
religious visions. The peaceful
quality of his painting and the happy
certainty of his faith move us to the deepest
admiration, but we may not forget that
Angelico lived from the time when he was
little more than a boy to the years when
he was an old man in the untroubled atmosphere
of the monastery of San Marco in
Florence, that whether he was at home in
that most favoured city or working in the
Vatican at Rome, he had no worldly troubles.
Honour, peace, and a mind at peace with
the world were with him always.</p>

<p>Bernardino Luini on the other hand
travelled from one town in Italy to another,
employed by religious houses from time to
time, but always as an artist who could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
relied upon to do good work cheaply. He
could not have been rich, he could hardly
have been famous, it is even reasonable
to suppose that his circumstances were
straitened, and on this account the unbroken
serenity of his work and his faithful
devotion to beauty are the more worthy of
our praise. What was beautiful in his life
and work came from within, not from without,
and perhaps because he was a stranger
to the cloistered seclusion that made Fra
Angelico&rsquo;s life so pleasantly uneventful his
work shows certain elements of strength that
are lacking from the frescoes that adorn the
walls of San Marco to this day. To his
contemporaries he was no more than a little
planet wandering at will round those fixed
stars of the first magnitude that lighted all
the world of art. Now some of those great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
stars have lost their light and the little
planet shines as clear as Hesperus.</p>

<p>As we have said already nothing is
known of Luini&rsquo;s early life, although the
fact that he was born at Luino on the Lago
Maggiore seems to be beyond dispute. The
people of that little lake side town have
no doubt at all about the matter, and they
say that the family was one of some distinction,
that Giacomo of Luino who founded
a monastery in his native place was the
painter&rsquo;s uncle. Perhaps the wish was
father to the thought, and because every
man who sets out to study the life and
work of an artist is as anxious to know as
was Miss Rosa Dartle herself, there are
always facts of a sort at his service. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
who seeks the truth can always be supplied
with something as much like it as paste
is to diamonds, and can supplement the
written word with the aid of tradition.
The early life of the artist is a blank, and
the authorities are by no means in agreement
about the year of his birth. 1470
would seem to be a reasonable date, with
a little latitude on either side. Many men
writing long years after the painter&rsquo;s death,
have held that he was a pupil of Leonardo
da Vinci, indeed several pictures that were
attributed to da Vinci by the authorities
of different European galleries are now recognised
as Luini&rsquo;s work, but the mistake
is not at all difficult to explain. If we turn
to &ldquo;La Joconda,&rdquo; a portrait by da Vinci
that hangs in the Louvre to-day, and is
apparently beyond dispute in the eyes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the present generation of critics, and then
go through the Brera in Milan with a
photograph of &ldquo;La Joconda&rsquo;s&rdquo; portrait in
our hand, it will be impossible to overlook
the striking resemblance between Luini&rsquo;s
types and da Vinci&rsquo;s smiling model. Leonardo
had an academy in Milan, and it is
reasonable to suppose that Luini worked in
it, although at the time when he is supposed
to have come for the first time to the capital
of Lombardy, Leonardo da Vinci had left,
apparently because Louis XII. of France,
cousin and successor of that Charles VIII.
who had troubled the peace of Italy for so
long, was thundering at the city gates, and
at such a time great artists were apt to
remember that they had good patrons elsewhere.
The school may, however, have remained
open because no great rulers made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
war on artists, and Luini would have learned
something of the spirit that animated Leonardo&rsquo;s
pictures. For other masters and
influence he seems to have gone to Bramantino
and Foppa. Bramantino was a
painter of Milan and Ambrosio Foppa
known as Caradosso was a native of Pavia
and should not be reckoned among Milanese
artists as he has so often been. He was
renowned for the beauty of his medals and his
goldsmith&rsquo;s work; and he was one of the men
employed by the great family of Bentivoglio.</p>

<span class="caption">PLATE IV.&mdash;THE MYSTIC MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE</span>
<p class="center"><b>(In the Brera, Milan)</b></p>

<p>This is a singularly attractive picture in which the child Christ
may be seen placing the ring upon the finger of St. Catherine. The
little open background, although free from the slightest suggestion
of Palestine, is very charming, and the head of the Virgin and St.
Catherine help to prove that Luini used few models.</p>
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE IV.&mdash;THE MYSTIC MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE" title="" />
</div>


<p>It may be mentioned in this place that
many Italian artists, particularly those of
the Florentine schools, suffered very greatly
from their unceasing devotion to the art of
the miniaturist. They sought to achieve
his detail, his fine but cramped handling,
and this endeavour was fatal to them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
when they came to paint large pictures
that demanded skilled composition, and the
subordination of detail to a large general
effect. The influence of the miniature
painter and the maker of medals kept
many a fifteenth-century painter in the
second grade and Luini never quite survived
his early devotion to their methods,
often making the fatal mistake of covering
a large canvas with many figures of varying
size but equal value. It may be remarked
that Tintoretto was the first great
painter of the Renaissance who learned to
subordinate parts to the whole, and he
had to face a great deal of unpopularity
because he saw with his own eyes instead
of using those of his predecessors.</p>

<span class="caption">PLATE V.&mdash;THE MADONNA OF THE ROSE</span>
<p class="center"><b>(In the Brera, Milan)</b></p>

<p>Modern criticism proclaims this picture of the Virgin in a Bower of
Roses to be the finest of the master&rsquo;s paintings. Not only is it
delightfully composed and thought out but the background is painted
with rare skill, and the colour is rich and pleasing to this day.</p>
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE V.&mdash;THE MADONNA OF THE ROSE" title="" />
</div>


<p>It may be suggested, with all possible
respect to those who hold different opinions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
that Luini, though he responded to certain
influences, had no master in the generally
accepted sense of the term. One cannot
trace the definite relation between him and
any older painter that we find between
Titian and Gian Bellini, for example. He
took a certain type from Leonardo, his
handling from time to time recalls the
other masters&mdash;we have already referred to
the most important of these&mdash;but had he
studied in the school of one man, had he
served an apprenticeship after the fashion
of his contemporaries, his pictures would
surely have been free from those faults of
composition and perspective that detract
so much from the value of the big works.
He seems to have been self-taught rather
than to have been a schoolman. While his
single figures are wholly admirable whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
on fresco or on panel, his grouping is nearly
always ineffective, one might say childish,
and his sense of perspective is by no means
equal to that of his greatest contemporaries.
As a draughtsman and a colourist Luini had
little to learn from anybody, and the poetry
of his conceptions is best understood when
it is remembered that he was a poet as well
as a painter. He is said to have written
poems and essays, though we are not in a
position to say where they are to be found,
and it is clear that he had a singularly detached
spirit and that the hand of a skilled
painter was associated with the mind of a
little child. In some aspects he is as simple
as those primitive painters of Umbria whose
backgrounds are all of gold. Like so many
other painters of the Renaissance Luini&rsquo;s
saints and angels are peasant folk, the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he saw around him. He may have idealised
them, but they remain as they were made.</p>

<p>A few records of the prices paid for
Luini&rsquo;s work exist among the documents
belonging to churches and religious houses,
and while they justify a belief that at the
time he came to Milan Luini had achieved
some measure of distinction in his calling,
they seem to prove that he was hardly regarded
as a great painter. The prices paid
to him are ridiculously small, no more than
a living wage, but he had the reputation of
being a reliable and painstaking artist and
he would seem to have been content with
a small reward for work that appealed to
him. His early commissions executed in
and around Milan when he first came from
Luini were numerous and consisted very
largely of frescoes which are the work of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
young man who has not yet freed his own
individuality from the influence of his elders.
One of the most charming works associated
with this period is the &ldquo;Burial of St.
Catherine,&rdquo; which is reproduced in these
pages. The composition is simple enough,
the handling does not touch the summit of
the painter&rsquo;s later achievements, but the
sentiment of the picture is quite delightful.
St. Catherine is conceived in a spirit of
deepest reverence and devotion, but the
angels are just Lombardy peasant girls
born to labour in the fields and now decorated
with wings in honour of a great
occasion. And yet the man who could
paint this fresco and could show so unmistakably
his own simple faith in the story
it sets out, was a poet as well as a painter
even though he had never written a line,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
while the treatment of his other contemporary
frescoes and the fine feeling for appropriate
colour suggest a great future for the
artist who had not yet reached middle age.
We see that Luini devoted his brush to
mythological and sacred subjects, touching
sacred history with a reverent hand, shutting
his eyes to all that was painful, expressing
all that was pitiful or calculated
to strengthen the hold of religion upon the
mass in fashion destined to appeal though
in changing fashion for at least four centuries.
Where the works have failed to
triumph as expressions of a living faith
they have charmed agnostics as an expression
of enduring beauty.</p>

<p>From Milan Luini seems to have gone
to Monza, a city a few miles away from
the capital of Lombardy where the rulers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of united Italy come after their coronation
to receive the iron crown that has been
worn by the kings of Lombardy for nearly
a thousand years. This is the city in
which the late King Umberto, that brave
and good man, was foully murdered by an
anarchist. To-day one reaches Monza by
the help of a steam-tram that blunders
heavily enough over the wide flat Lombardy
plain. The Milanese go to Monza for the
sake of an outing, but most of the tourists
who throng the city stay away, and it is
possible to spend a few pleasant hours in
the cathedral and churches with never a
flutter of red-covered guide book to distract
one&rsquo;s attention from the matters to
which the hasty tourist is blind. Here
Luini painted frescoes, and it is known that
he stayed for a long time at the house of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
one of the strong men of Monza and
painted a large number of frescoes there.
To-day the fortress, if it was one, has
become a farmhouse, and the frescoes,
more than a dozen in all, have been taken
away to the Royal Palace in Milan. Dr.
Williamson in his interesting volume to
which the student of Luini must be deeply
indebted, says that there is one left at the
Casa Pelucca. The writer in the course
of two days spent in Monza was unfortunate
enough to overlook it.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the facts relating
to Luini&rsquo;s life are few and far between.
Fiction on the other hand is plentiful, and
there is a story that Luini, shortly after
his arrival in Milan, was held responsible
by the populace for the death of a priest
who fell from a hastily erected scaffolding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
in the church of San Giorgio where the
artist was working. The rest of the legend
follows familiar lines that would serve the
life story of any leading artist of the time,
seeing that they all painted altar-pieces
and used scaffolding. He is said to have
fled to Monza, to have been received by
the chief of the Pelucca family, to have
paid for his protection with the frescoes
that have now been brought from Monza
to the Brera, to have fallen violently in
love with the beautiful daughter of the
house, to have engaged in heroic contests
against great odds on her behalf, and so on,
<i>ad absurdum</i>. If we look at the portraits
the painter is said to have made of himself
and to have placed in pictures at
Saronna and elsewhere we shall see that
Luini was hardly the type of man to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
engaged in the idle pursuits of chivalry in
the intervals of the work to which his life
was given. We have the head of a man
of thought not that of a man of action,
and all the character of the face gives the
lie to the suggestions of the storytellers.
It is clear, however, that the painter made
a long stay in Monza and when he came
back to Milan he worked for the churches
of St. Maurizio, Santa Maria della Pace,
Santa Maria di Brera, and St. Ambrosia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%;">

<p>This prettily posed figure is at the base of a fresco of the Virgin
with Saints in the Brera. Part of the artist&rsquo;s signature (Bernardinus
Louinus) may be seen below. It will be remembered that Carpaccio
painted a very similar subject. The fresco is not too well preserved.</p>
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE VI.&mdash;DETAIL OF FRESCO" title="" />
</div>


<p>In Milan he found a great patron, no
less a man than Giovanni Bentivoglio who
had been driven from his rule over Bologna
by the &ldquo;Terrible Pontiff&rdquo; Julius II., that
life-long opponent and bitter enemy of the
Borgia Pope Alexander VI. Alessandro
Bentivoglio, the son of the ruined Giovanni,
married Ippolita Sforza, daughter of one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of the house that had done so much to
rule Rome until Pope Alexander VI. broke
its power. Alessandro Bentivoglio commissioned
Luini to paint altar-pieces in
St. Maurizio where his father was buried, and
the painter included in his work a portrait of
Ippolita Sforza with three female saints. He
did much other work in this church; some of
it has faded almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>At the same time there is no need to
think that we have recovered the last work
of Luini or indeed of the great masters
even in the churches of Italy. Only a few
months ago the writer was in a small
Italian church that had suffered a few
years ago from disastrous floods. The
water unable to find no outlet had risen
for a time almost to the top of the supporting
columns. The smooth wall above was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
plastered, and when the waters had subsided
it was found that the plaster had become
so damaged that it was necessary to remove
it. Happily the work was done
carefully, for under the whitewash some
excellent frescoes were discovered. They
would seem to have profited by their covering
for as much as has been uncovered is
rich and well preserved. It may be that
in days when the State of Italy was seriously
disturbed, and Napoleon, greatest of highwaymen
and conquerors, after being crowned
in Milan with the famous Monza crown,
was laying his hand on all that seemed
worth carrying away, some one in authority
thought of this simple method of concealment,
and obtained expert advice that
enabled the frescoes to be covered without
serious damage. Under similar conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
we may yet discover some of the earlier
work of Luini, because it is clear that the
years in which his reputation was in the
making must have been full of achievement
of which the greater part has now been
lost. He could hardly have been less than
thirty years of age when he came to Milan
with a reputation sufficient to gain commissions
for work in churches; that reputation
must have taken years to acquire, and
must have been associated with very definite
accomplishment. The lack of all record
was essentially the misfortune that beset
men who were not very high in the esteem
of their contemporaries. A painter like
Luini would have executed a great many
pictures for people who could not pay very
well, and had no great gallery or well-built
church to harbour the work, and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
course of time the work would tend
inevitably to disappear before the devouring
candle-smoke, or to be carried away
by unscrupulous purchasers who chanced
to be better equipped with taste than
conscience. On the other hand, painters
who led the various movements of their
time would be honoured by successive
generations and their work would be stored
in the best and safest places. To be sure,
fire was never a respecter of palaces or
persons, and the flames have consumed
more work than a collection of the finest
Renaissance pictures in existence could
show, but even then the odds seem to be
in favour of the bigger men because special
efforts would be made to save their paintings
while those of lesser men would be
left with few regrets to take their chance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>When Luini was engaged to work in
the Church of St. Maurizio there was
a fair chance that his altar-pieces and
frescoes would be well looked after, but
when he worked for a small provincial
family like the Pelucca the house sank
with the family fortunes till at last it became
a farm, and in the early years of the nineteenth
century the frescoes were taken
from the walls with as much care as was
deemed advisable. Doubtless Luini worked
for many men whose worldly position was
not as considerable as that of the Pelucca
family, and that work may have disappeared
altogether. The painter, as we have
seen, did not enjoy the patronage of many
great men before Alessandro Bentivoglio, and
large institutions were not numbered among
his early clients. But he was not altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
without valuable patronage in the latter
days, and in the early &rsquo;twenties of the sixteenth
century the influential Brotherhood
of the Holy Crown, one of the leading
charitable institutions of Milan, would seem
to have given him some official connection
with their institution; a recognised
position without fixed salary. For them he
painted the magnificent frescoes now in the
Ambrosian Library. The great work there
was divided by the artist into three parts
separated by pillars. In the centre Luini
has depicted the crowning with thorns,
Christ being seated upon a throne while
thorns are being put upon His head; His
arms are crossed; His expression one of
supreme resignation. Above Him little
angels look down or point to a cartouche
on which is written &ldquo;Caput Regis Glori&aelig;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Spinis Coranatur.&rdquo; In the left hand division
of the fresco and on the right, the fore-ground
is filled with kneeling figures whose
heads are supposed to be portraits of the
most prominent members of the Society.
Clearly they are all men who have achieved
some measure of honour and distinction.
Above the kneeling figures on the left hand
side St. John is pointing out the tragedy
of the central picture to the Virgin Mary,
while on the right hand side a man in
armour and another who is seen faintly
behind him call the attention of a third to
what is happening. A crown of thorns
hangs above the right and the left hand
compartment and there is a landscape for
background. It is recorded that this work
took about six months, and was finished in
March 1522 at a cost to the Society of 115<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
soldi. So Luini&rsquo;s work looks down to-day
upon a part of the great Ambrosian Library,
and it may well be that the library itself will
yield to patient investigation some record,
however simple, of the painter&rsquo;s life, sufficient
perhaps to enable us to readjust our mental
focus and see his lovable figure more clearly.</p>

<span class="caption">PLATE VII.&mdash;HEAD OF VIRGIN</span>
<p class="center"><b>(In the Ambrosiana, Milan)</b></p>

<p>Here we have another well painted and finely preserved head
painted from one of Luini&rsquo;s favourite models. The artist must have
known most of the secrets of colour preparation, for his work has
survived much that was painted centuries later. Unfortunately his
frescoes were exposed to the elements and have suffered accordingly.</p>
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE VII.&mdash;HEAD OF VIRGIN" title="" />
</div>


<p>It may be urged that for those of us
who are content to see with the spiritual
eye Luini is expressed more eloquently by
his work, and particularly by this great
picture in the Ambrosian Library, than he
could hope to be by the combined efforts
of half-a-dozen critics, each with his own
special point of view and his properly profound
contempt for the views of others. The
painter&rsquo;s low tones and subtle harmonies,
his pure but limited vision, speak to us of a
gentle, refined, and delicate nature, of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
achievement that stopped short of cleverness
and consequently limited him to the
quieter byways of artistic life, while those
whose inspiration was less, and whose
gifts were more, moved with much pomp
and circumstance before admiring contemporaries.
The refined mind, the sensitive
soul, shrank from depicting the tragedy of
the Crown of Thorns in the realistic fashion
that would have proved acceptable to so
many other artists. Luini forgets the blood
and the spikes, he almost forgets the
physical pain, and gives us the Man of
Sorrows who has forgiven His tormentors
because &ldquo;they know not what they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Continental galleries show us many treatments
of the same familiar theme, they have
none to show that can vie with this in a
combination of strength and delicacy that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sets out an immortal story while avoiding
the brutal realism to which so many other
artists have succumbed. We may suppose
that the objects of the Society roused Luini&rsquo;s
sympathy to an extent that made it easy
for him to accept the somewhat paltry
remuneration with which the Brotherhood
of the Holy Crown rewarded him, and so
the picture makes its own appeal on the
painter&rsquo;s behalf, and tells a story of his
claims upon our regard. A man may lie, in
fact it may be suggested on the strength of
the Psalmist&rsquo;s statement that most men do,
but an artist&rsquo;s life work tells his story in spite
of himself, and if he labour with pen or brush
his truest biography will be seen in what
he leaves behind him. It is not possible to
play a part throughout all the vicissitudes
of a long career, and no man could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
given us the pictures that Luini has left
unless he chanced to be a choice and rare
spirit. We may remember here and now
that the time was richer in violent contrasts
than any of its successors, the most
deplorable excesses on the one hand, the
most rigid virtues on the other, seem to
have been the special product of the Renaissance.
While there were men who
practised every vice under the sun there
were others who sought to arrest Divine
Retribution by the pursuit of all the virtues,
and while the progress of the years has to
a certain extent made men neutral tinted
in character, the season of the Renaissance
was one of violent contrasts. On behalf of
the section that went in pursuit of righteousness
let it be remembered that heaven and
the saints were not matters for specula<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tion,
they were certainties. Every man
knew that God was in heaven, and that if
the workers of iniquity flourished, it was that
they might be destroyed for ever. Every
man knew that the saints still exerted their
supernatural powers and would come down
to earth if need be to protect a devotee.
Satan, on the other hand, went armed
about the earth seeking whom he might
devour, and hell was as firmly fixed as
heaven. In order to understand Luini, his
life and times, these facts must be borne
in mind. The greater the unrest in the
cities the more the public attention would
be turned to statesmen and warriors, and
when the personalities of artists began to
be considered, those who lived and thrived
in the entourage of popes and rulers monopolised
the attention. Hundreds of men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
were at work earning a fair living and
some local repute, it was left to foreign
favour to set a seal upon success. Had
Luini chanced to be invited to Venice or
to Rome he would have been honoured
throughout Lombardy; but a painter like
a prophet is often without honour in his
own country. Luini&rsquo;s gifts were of a more
quiet and domestic order than those of his
great contemporaries Leonardo da Vinci and
Michelangelo, for example, were more than
painters, and perhaps it was only in Venice
that painting stood by itself and managed
to thrive alone. Luini would have come
into his kingdom while he lived had Venice
been his birthplace. The genius of the
Florentine school sought to express itself
in half-a-dozen different ways, no triumph
in one department of work could satisfy
men whose longing for self-expression was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
insatiable. In those days it was possible
for a man to make himself master of all
knowledge, literally he could discourse <i>de
omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis</i>. And
this diffusion of interests was fatal to many
a genius that might have moved to amazing
triumph along one road.</p>

<p>It is clear that Bernardino Luini never
travelled very far from his native country
either physically or mentally. In the eyes
of his contemporaries he was not a man of
sufficient importance to receive commissions
from the great art centres of Italy. This,
of course, may be because he did not have
the good fortune to attract the attention of
the connoisseurs of his day, for we find that
outside Milan, and the little town of Luino
where he was born and whence he took
his name, his work was done in comparatively
small towns like Como, Legnano,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Lugano, Ponte, and Saronno. Milan and
Monza may be disregarded because we
have already dealt with the work there.
Saronno, which lies some fourteen miles
north-west of Milan, is little more than a
village to-day, and its chief claim upon the
attention of the traveller is its excellent
gingerbread for which it is famous throughout
Lombardy. It has a celebrated church
known as the Sanctuary of the Blessed
Virgin and here one finds some very fine
examples of our painter&rsquo;s frescoes. Some
of the frescoes in the church are painted
by Cesare del Magno others by Lanini, and
the rest are from the hand of Bernardino
Luini. Round these frescoes, which are of
abiding beauty, and include fine studies
of the great plague saint, St. Roque, and
that very popular martyr St. Sebastian,
many legends congregate. It is said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Luini having killed a man in a brawl fled
from Milan to the Church of the Blessed
Virgin in Monza to claim sanctuary at the
hand of the monks. They gave him the
refuge he demanded, and, says the legend,
he paid for it with frescoes. This is little
more than a variant of the story that he
went to Monza under similar circumstances
and obtained the protection of the Pelucca
family on the same terms. In the absence
of anything in the nature of reliable record
this story has been able to pass, but against
it one likes to put the tradition that one of the
heads in the frescoes is that of Luini himself.
We find that head so simple, so refined, and
so old&mdash;the beard is long and the hair is
scanty&mdash;and so serene in its expression
that it is exceedingly difficult to believe
that brawling could have entered into the
artist&rsquo;s life.</p>

<span class="caption">PLATE VIII.&mdash;BURIAL OF ST. CATHERINE</span>
<p class="center"><b>(In the Brera, Milan)</b></p>

<p>This is one of the frescoes painted by Luini for the Casa Pelucca
and transferred to Milan in the beginning of the nineteenth century.
It will be seen that although the three angels bearing the Saint to
her grave are obviously peasant girls from the plains of Lombardy
winged for the occasion, the artist has handled his subject with faith
and reverence. The fresco is better preserved than others from the
same house.</p>

<p>The subjects of the pictures in Saronno&rsquo;s
Sanctuary are all biblical. We have an
Adoration of the Magi, showing the same
muddled composition that detracts from the
other merits of the artist&rsquo;s work; a beautiful
Presentation in the Temple in which the
composition is a great deal better; and a
perfectly delightful Nativity. There is a
Christ is Disputing with the Doctors, and
this is the picture in which we find the
head that is said to be a portrait of the
painter himself. Two female saints figure
in another picture, and Luini&rsquo;s favourites
St. Roque and St. Sebastian are not forgotten.
Certainly if the monks obtained all
that work at the price of the painter&rsquo;s safety
they were very fortunate in his choice of
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Como is, of course, a more important
town with large industries and important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
factories, and one of the finest cathedrals
in northern Italy. For the interior Luini
painted another Adoration of the Magi and
another of his favourite Nativities. It is
not easy to speak about the conditions
under which this work was done, and the
inhabitants have so many more profitable
matters to attend to that they do not seem
to trouble themselves about the history of
the painter who helped to make their
beautiful cathedral still more beautiful.</p>

<p>Legnano, with its memories of Frederick
Barbarossa, is within twenty miles of Milan,
and for the Church of San Magno Luini
painted one of his finest altar-pieces. It
is in seven divisions and has earned as
much critical admiration as any work from
the master&rsquo;s brush.</p>

<p>Lugano is of course in Switzerland, well
across the Italian border. It is a popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
place enough to-day, and so far as we can
tell, it was the city in which Luini painted
his last pictures. He must have left Milan
about 1528 or 1529, and he would seem to
have gone there to execute commissions,
for in the Church of Santa Maria degli
Angioli we find some of his latest and finest
work. The Crucifixion and the Passion, on
the wall of the screen, contains several hundred
figures arranged in lines in most
archaic fashion. At first sight the work
appears as a mere mass of figures without
any central point in the composition, and
with very little relief for the eye of the
spectator who may come to the church
surfeited with the bewildering riches of
many Italian galleries. But for those who
will take the trouble to study the details
of this fine work there is very much to
admire. In the scene of the picture Christ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
is seen on the cross surrounded by angels.
On his right hand the penitent thief on the
cross is guarded by an angel, while on the
left the impenitent one is watched by a devil
with a curly tail and spiked wings. Below
in perfectly bewildering fashion are many
figures that may be recognised with little
effort&mdash;Mary Magdalen, the Madonna,
Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, Roman soldiers, some
of the general public&mdash;a confused crowd.
The whole picture is supported by figures
of San Sebastian and St. Roque seen on
either side of the arch. Stories from the
life of Christ are depicted in the upper
parts of the picture, all are painted with
the skill of a great artist and the fervour
of a devotee, but the arrangement is hopelessly
confused. Luini also painted a &ldquo;Last
Supper&rdquo; for this church and a &ldquo;Madonna
with the Infant Christ and St. John.&rdquo; This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
is signed &ldquo;Bernardino Luini, anno 1530.&rdquo;
From 1530 until 1533 the career of the
artist cannot be traced, but in 1533 he was
in Lugano again, and after that year he
passes altogether from our sight. Stray
writers mention his name, some venture to
carry the date of his life into the &rsquo;forties,
but we have no proof save their word, no
work to record the later years, and all our
conjecture is vain. It must suffice for us
that Luini&rsquo;s life as far as his art was concerned
ends for us with the year 1533. If
he lived and worked after that date the
facts relating to the following years and
the work done in the latter days are left
for future students to discover. It is well
to remember that the Saronno portrait
makes the painter look much older than
he is supposed to have been.</p>

<p>To his contemporaries it is clear that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Luini was a man of small importance. His
best work is seen outside the radius of the
great Art centres of Italy, and it was only
when he attracted the attention of great
critics and sound judges like Morelli, John
Ruskin, and John Addington Symonds that
the lovers of beautiful pictures began to go
out of their way to find his best work in
the little towns whose churchmen were his
patrons. So many of the lesser men had
all his faults&mdash;that is to say, lack of perspective
and inability to compose a big
picture&mdash;that he was classed with them by
those critics whose special gift lies in the
discovery of faults. The qualities that make
the most enduring appeal to us to-day were
those that were least likely to make a
strong impression upon the strenuous age
of physical force in which he lived. When
great conquerors and men who had accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>plished
all that force could achieve felt
themselves at liberty to turn to prolonged
consideration of the other sides of life they
employed other masters. Then as now there
were fashions in painters. The men for
whom Luini strove were of comparatively
small importance. A conqueror could have
gathered up in the hollow of his hand all
the cities, Milan excepted, in which Luini
worked throughout his well-spent life, and
in the stress and strife of the later years
when great pictures did change hands from
time to time by conquest, Luini&rsquo;s panel
pictures in the little cities of his labours
passed quite unnoticed, while even if the frescoes
were admired it was not easy to move
them. When at last his undoubted merits
began to attract attention of connoisseurs,
these connoisseurs were wondering why
Leonardo da Vinci had left such a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
number of pictures. They found work that
bore a great resemblance to Leonardo and
they promptly claimed that they had
discovered the lost masterpieces. Consequently
Leonardo received the credit that
was due to the man who may have worked
in his Milanese school and was undoubtedly
under his influence for a time. And many of
the beautiful panel pictures that show Luini
at his best were attributed to Leonardo
until nineteenth-century criticism proved
competent enough to render praise where
it was due, and to say definitely and with
firm conviction that the unknown painter
from Luino, who lived sometime between
1470 and 1540, was the true author.</p>

<p>If, in dealing with the life of Bernardino
Luini, we are forced to content ourselves with
meagre scraps of biography and little details
that would have no importance at all in deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ing
with a life that was traceable from early
days to its conclusion, it is well to remember
that the most important part of the great
artist is his work. Beethoven&rsquo;s nine symphonies,
Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; the landscapes
of Corot, the portraits of Velazquez,
and the carving of Grinling Gibbons are
not more precious to us because we know
something of the life of the men who did
the work. Nor are the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; and the fragments
that remain of the works of the
great Greek sculptors less to us because a
shadowy tradition is all that surrounds the
lives of the men who gave immortal work
to the world. We must remember that it
is as difficult to deal with art in terms of
literature as it is to express the subtle
charm of music in words. Had Luini&rsquo;s years
boasted or regretted a series of gossiping
newspapers we should have gathered a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
rich harvest of fact, but the facts would
have left the painter where he is. There
is enough of Luini left in Milan and the
smaller places we have named to tell us
what the man was and the spirit in which
he worked, and while we will welcome the
new-comer who can add to our scanty
store of authenticated facts we can hardly
expect that they will deepen our admiration
of work that for all its shortcomings
must be remembered when we turn to
ponder the greatest achievements of Italian
Art. It forms &ldquo;a magic speculum, much
gone to rust, indeed, yet in fragments still
clear; wherein the marvellous image of his
existence does still shadow itself, though
fitfully, and as with an intermittent light.&rdquo;</p>
